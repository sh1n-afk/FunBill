Funbill is an interactive web application designed to simplify the process of splitting bills among friends and family. Built using React and styled with Chakra UI, this app offers a user-friendly interface complete with registration, login, and dynamic transaction management features. Users can create and manage transactions through a clear and responsive layout, including a navigation bar and sidebar for easy access to different sections. Funbill incorporates modern web practices such as responsive design and service worker integration, making it both performant and accessible. This project not only showcases my frontend development skills but also highlights my ability to recreate complex functionalities in a straightforward, effective manner.
