            <br><h2>How do I use FunBill?</h2>
                <p>FunBill is a web application for splitting expenses with your friends. It lets you and your 
                    friends add various transactions and keep track of who owes who. You can add friends and create groups 
                    with links or QR codes. Here's a quick overview of how it works.</p>
                <br><p>First, sign up for an account!</p>   
                <br><p>Next, add a transaction. Here you can specify who you'd like to add to the bill, and how much their 
                    share of the bill will be. Once the transaction is created, if you're already friends with a person 
                    that owes you money, they'll be notified on their account. If you're planning to split with someone 
                    who hasn't signed up for FunBill, they can pay you back via link or QR code.</p>
                <br><p>Once you've received a payment, you'll be able to view the receipt on your transaction logs. If a 
                    friend needs a reminder, you can do that within the website by clicking the reminder button next 
                    to the transaction details.</p> 
                <br><p>If you plan on having reoccurring expenses with certain people, consider creating a group.</p>    
                <br><p>Those are the basics, and should be enough to get you started. If you have more questions, 
                    check out the rest of our FAQ page!</p>

            
            <br><br><h2>How do I invite a friend?</h2>
                <p>Once you've logged into your account, at the bottom of the Dashboard menu you'll find a section that 
                    allows you to add a friend with their email. Type their email into the box and hit Invite. </p>
                <br><p>If you've added the person to a transaction before, you can search for their name in the searchbar 
                    or previous transactions menu. Clicking on their name will give you an option to add them as a friend. </p>
                <br><p>Once they've accepted the request, you can find their name under Friends, located on your Dashboard
                    side panel.  </p>


            <br><br><h2>How do I create a group?</h2>
                <p>Once you've logged into your account, the second row of of the Dashboard should display all your current groups.
                    Click on the Groups header to open up a page listing all of your current groups. At the right corner of the page 
                    is a button to Create a Group. You can directly add friends to the group, or copy the invite link to be send to 
                    whomever.</p>
                <br><p>Once the group has been created, you can view the group under Groups, located on your Dashboard.</p>
